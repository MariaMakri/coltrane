examples/frontiers2016_6oct2016/ contains code that runs the experiments discussed in Banas et al. 2016, Front. Mar. Res., 2016. In order, these are
globalExampleCase.m
globalExpts.m
beringExpts.m
diskoPhiExpts.m
diskoExpts.m
...and also code that generates most of the figures in that paper. Some of the analysis code may not be final and the embedded graphics code certainly is not, but is included here to provide hints about how to use the many fields returned in the output from coltraneModel.m.

see globalExampleCase.m for the simplest example of how to run the model for an idealised scenario.

Since then, the output structures have been heavily reorganised, so this code will not run--but you can checkout a separate working copy of the 6 Oct 2016 version of the model on github, and it should.



examples/frontiers2016_4aug2017/ contains selected cases from Banas et al., Front. Mar. Sci., 2016 updated to a more recent model version. This is close to the code version that Laura Hobbs and Euan McRae were working with as of mid 2018.
