examples/frontiers2016/ contains code that runs the experiments discussed in Banas et al. 2016, Front. Mar. Res., submitted: in order,
globalExampleCase.m
globalExpts.m
beringExpts.m
diskoPhiExpts.m
diskoExpts.m
...and also code that generates most of the figures in that paper. Some of the analysis code may not be final and the embedded graphics code certainly is not, but is included here to provide hints about how to use the many fields returned in the output from coltraneModel.m.

see globalExampleCase.m for the simplest example of how to run the model for an idealised scenario.
